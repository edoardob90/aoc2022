# Advent of Code 2022 🎄🎅

![](cover.jpg)

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a coding challenge from December 1st until Christmas created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). The puzzles will unlock everyday at Midnight (UTC-5) until the 25th of December.

Each folder corresponds to a day of the calendar and, in each folder, the `README.md` contains the first part of the day's puzzle. To unlock the second part, you must submit the correct solution that you obtained with your input.

As the inputs are different for each user, use the `input.txt` files in each day's folder only if you want to test your solution against my inputs.
